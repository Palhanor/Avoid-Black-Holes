# A simple game in JavaScript

## Summary
**Proposal:** To practice pure JavaScript development I decided to create a game based on the famous "Snake", where the player needs to reach the food while avoiding the black holes that appear. Thus, one or more black holes are created every time the player manages to reach a food, generating an increasing difficulty for the player.

**Developed by:** Lucas Palhano

### Major Bugs
- [ ] The black hole appears in the same position as the player
- [ ] The player can walk off the canvas (x: -20px & y: -20px)
- [ ] The game can continue after the end of the game if the user presses any of the arrows
- [ ] There is no handling of input data
- [ ] Bad formatting of HTML, SASS and JavaScript codes
- [ ] The codes are written in pt-br
- [ ] There is no responsiveness on the page

### Future Features
- [ ] Implement grid control on the panel (lines or clean)
- [ ] Implement border control in dashboard (teleport or solid)
- [ ] Add language selector (pt-br or en)
- [ ] Add donation field (using Nanocurrency)
- [ ] Mapping through a two-dimensional array in JavaScript
- [ ] Add header navigation
- [ ] Add modal with game rules
- [ ] Add option to share final game score
- [ ] Improve scoreboard design
- [ ] Implement dark mode theme option
- [ ] Add shadow with blur on black holes
- [ ] Create design documentation
- [ ] Improve the design of input fields
- [ ] Implement game controls (Play; Pause; Reset; Quit)
- [ ] Implement a multiplayer system
- [ ] Add support for mobile devices
- [ ] Add a global ranking
